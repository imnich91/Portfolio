title: Empty space prompt
description: 'There are three primary uses for empty space prompts:
<ol>
<li>First use. The user begins to interact with the application/site.</li>
<li>User cleared. The user has just completed a task or cleared all content associated with the app or site.</li>
<li>The user has encountered a roadblock during the interaction.</li>
</ol>
Empty space prompts should help the user guide them along to the next logical step.'
guidelines:
  do:
    - Use as a space for increasing adoption if the user has never used the application before
    - Prompt users towards new interactions when they have completed required tasks
    - Indicate that no results are available after the user has entered a search
  dont:
    - Use to indicate that there are unfinished tasks still available
    - Use when there are available results
